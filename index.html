<p>The two instances of <em>modern</em> in the title of this book reflect the two
major recent revolutions in biological data analyses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Biology, formerly a science with sparse, often only qualitative data
has turned into a field whose production of quantitative data is on
par with high energy physics or astronomy, and whose data are wildly
more heterogeneous and complex.</p></li>
<li><p>Statistics, a field that in the 20th century had become an
application ground for probability theory and calculus, often taught
loaded with notation and perceived with a heavy emphasis on
hypothesis testing, has been transformed by the ubiquity of
computers and of data in machine-readable form. Exploratory data
analysis, visualization, resampling, simulations, pragmatic
hybridizations of Bayesian ideas and methods with frequentist data
analysis have become part of the toolset.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The aim of this book is to enable scientists working in biological
research to quickly learn many of the important ideas and methods that
they need to make the best of their experiments and of other available
data. The book takes a hands-on approach. The narrative in each chapter
is driven by classes of questions, or by certain data types. Methods and
theory are introduced on a need-to-know basis. We don’t try to
systematically deduce from first principles. The book will often throw
readers into the pool and hope they can swim in spite of so many missing
details.</p>
<p>By no means this book will replace systematic training in underlying
theory: probability, linear algebra, computer science, databases,
multivariate statistics. Such training takes many semesters of
coursework. Perhaps the book will whet your appetite to engage more
deeply with one of these fields.</p>

<p>Real scientific discovery rarely works in the caricature manner of
Figure <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/introduction.html#fig:intro-Fisher">0.1</a>.
Tukey
(<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/introduction.html#ref-Tukey77">1977</a>)
emphasized two separate approaches. The first he termed <strong>exploratory
data analysis</strong> (<strong>EDA</strong>). EDA uses the data themselves to decide how to
conduct the statistical analysis. EDA is built on simple tools for
plotting data. EDA is complemented by <strong>confirmatory data analyses</strong>
(CDA): robust inferential methods that do not rely on complex
assumptions to reach scientific conclusions. Tukey recommended an
iterative approach schematized in
Figure <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/introduction.html#fig:intro-iterative">0.2</a>
that enable us to see the data at different resolutions and from
different perspectives. This enables the refinement of our understanding
of the data.</p>
<p>Biology in the late 1990s raised the <strong>large-</strong>pp small-nn problem:
consider a gene expression dataset for n=200n=200 patient samples on
p=20000p=20000 genes. If we want to construct a regression or
classification model that "predicts" a clinical variable, for instance
the disease type or outcome, from the 20,000 genes, or features, we
immediately run into problems11 Called <em>non-identifiabilty</em> or
<em>overfitting</em>., since the number of model parameters would have to be
orders of magnitudes larger than the number of replicate measurements
nn. At least, this is the case for common models, say, an ordinary
linear model. Statisticians realized that they could remedy the
situation by requiring sparsity through the use of regularization
techniques (Hastie, Tibshirani, and Friedman
<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/introduction.html#ref-HastieTibshiraniFriedman">2008</a>),
i.e., by requiring that many of the potential parameters are either zero
or at least close to it.</p>
<p>A generalization of the sparsity principle is attained by invoking one
of the most powerful recent ideas in high-dimensional statistics, which
goes under the name of <strong>empirical Bayes</strong>: we don't try to learn the
parameters associated with each feature from scratch, but rather use the
fact that some or all of them will be similar, or even the same, across
all features, or across groups of related features. There are several
important book long treatments (Efron
<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/introduction.html#ref-Efron2010">2010</a>)
of the subject of large scale inference so essential in modern
estimation and hypotheses testing.</p>

<p>We’ll use this icon to identify when we are using a Monte Carlo
approximation method. This name for the method is used because it uses
randomness, similar to the randomness of casino games. Ironically, for
many casino games the probabilities of winning is not known
analytically, and casinos use their own empirical data to evaluate the
odds of winning.</p>
<p><em>Simulations</em> play an essential role in this book, as many of the
results we need escape the reach of standard analytic approaches. In
other words, simulations liberate us from being able to only consider
methods that are analytically tractable, and from worrying about the
appropriateness of simplifying assumptions or approximations.</p>
<p>In this book, we try to cover the full range of these developments and
their applications to current biological research. We cover many
different types of data that modern biologists have to deal with,
including RNA-Seq, flow-cytometry, taxa abundances, imaging data and
single cell measurements. We assume no prior training in statistics.
However, you'll need some familiarity with R and willingness to engage
in mathematical and analytical thinking.</p>
<p><em>Generative models</em> are our basic building blocks. In order to draw
conclusions about complicated data it tends to be useful to have simple
models for the data generated under this or that situation. We do this
through the use of probability theory and generative models, which we
introduce in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Generative.html#Chap:Generative">1</a>.
We will use examples from immunology and DNA analysis to describe useful
generative models for biological data: binomial, multinomial and Poisson
random variables.</p>
<p>Once we know how data would look like under a certain model, we can
start working our way backwards: given some data, what model is most
likely able to explain it? This <em>bottom up approach</em> is the core of
statistical thinking, and we explain it in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Models.html#Chap:Models">2</a>.</p>
<p>We saw the primary role of <em>graphics</em> in Tukey's scheme
(Figure <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/introduction.html#fig:intro-iterative">0.2</a>),
and so we'll learn how to visualize our data in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Graphics.html#Chap:Graphics">3</a>.
We'll use the grammar of graphics and
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/"><strong>ggplot2</strong></a>.</p>
<p>Real biological data often have more complex distributional properties
than what we could cover in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Generative.html#Chap:Generative">1</a>.
We'll use mixtures that we explore in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Mixtures.html#Chap:Mixtures">4</a>;
these enable us to build realistic models for heterogeneous biological
data and provide solid foundations for choosing appropriate variance
stabilizing transformations.</p>
<p>The large, matrix-like (n×pn×p) datasets in biology naturally lend
themselves to clustering: once we define a distance measure between
matrix rows (the features), we can cluster and group the genes by
similarity of their expression patterns, and similarly, for the columns
(the patient samples). We'll cover clustering in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Clustering.html#Chap:Clustering">5</a>.
Since clustering only relies on distances, we can even apply it to data
that are not matrix-shaped, as long as there are objects and distances
defined between them.</p>
<p>Further following the path of EDA, we cover the most fundamental
unsupervised analysis method for simple matrices –<em>principal component
analysis</em>– in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Multivariate.html#Chap:Multivariate">7</a>.
We turn to more heterogeneous data that combine multiple data types in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-MultivaHetero.html#Chap:MultivaHetero">9</a>.
There, we'll see nonlinear unsupervised methods for counts from single
cell data. We'll also address how to use generalizations of the
multivariate approaches covered in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Multivariate.html#Chap:Multivariate">7</a>
to combinations of categorical variables and multiple assays recorded on
the same observational units.</p>
<p>The basic hypothesis testing workflow outlined in
Figure <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/introduction.html#fig:intro-Fisher">0.1</a>
is explained in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Testing.html#Chap:Testing">6</a>.
We use the opportunity to apply it to one of the most common queries to
n×pn×p-datasets: which of the genes (features) are <em>associated with</em> a
certain property of the samples, say, disease type or outcome? However,
conventional significance thresholds would lead to lots of spurious
associations: with a false positive rate of α=0.05α=0.05 we expect
pα=1000pα=1000 false positives if none of the p=20000p=20000 features
has a true association. Therefore we also need to deal with multiple
testing.</p>
<p>One of the most fruitful ideas in statistics is that of variance
decomposition, or analysis of variance (ANOVA). We'll explore this, in
the framework of linear models and generalized linear models, in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-CountData.html#Chap:CountData">8</a>.
Since we'll draw our example data from an RNA-Seq experiment, this
gives us also an opportunity to discuss models for such count data, and
concepts of <em>robustness</em>.</p>
<p>Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution22
Theodosius Dobzhansky,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution" class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_in_Biology_Makes_Sense_Except_in_the_Light_of_Evolution</a>,
and evolutionary relationships are usefully encoded in phylogenetic
trees. We'll explore networks and trees in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Graphs.html#Chap:Graphs">10</a>.</p>
<p>A rich source of data in biology is images, and in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Images.html#Chap:Images">11</a>
we reinforce our willingness to do EDA on all sorts of heterogeneous
data types by exploring feature extraction from images and spatial
statistics.</p>
<p>Finally in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Supervised.html#Chap:Supervised">12</a>,
we will look at statistical learning, i.e., training an algorithm to
distinguish between different types of objects depending on their
multidimensional feature vector. We'll start simple with
low-dimensional feature vectors and linear methods, and then explore
classification in high-dimensional settings.</p>
<p>We wrap up in
Chapter <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book/Chap-Design.html#Chap:Design">13</a>
with considerations on good practices in the design of experiments and
of data analyses. For this we'll use and reflect what we have learned
in the course of the preceding chapters.</p>

<p>As we’ll see over and over again, the analysis approaches, tools and
choices to be made are manifold. Our work can only be validated by
keeping careful records in a reproducible script format. R and
Bioconductor provide such a platform.</p>
<p>Although we are tackling many different types of data, questions and
statistical methods hands-on, we maintain a consistent computational
approach by keeping all the computation under one roof: the R
programming language and statistical environment, enhanced by the
biological data infrastructure and specialized method packages from the
Bioconductor project. The reader will have to start by acquiring some
familiarity with R before using the book. There are many good books and
online resources. One of them is by Grolemund and Wickham (2017), online
at <a href="http://r4ds.had.co.nz" class="uri">http://r4ds.had.co.nz</a>.</p>
<p>R code is a major component of this book. It is how we make the textual
explanations explicit. Virtually every data visualization in the book is
produced with code that is shown, and the reader should be able to
replicate all of these figures, and any other results shown.</p>
<p>Even if you have a basic familiarity with R, don’t worry if you don’t
immediately understand every line of code in the book. Although we have
tried to keep the code explicit and give tips and hints at potentially
challenging places, there will be instances where</p>
<p>there is a function invoked that you have not seen before and that does
something mysterious,</p>
<p>there is a complicated R expression that you don’t understand (perhaps
involving apply-functions or data manipulations from the dplyr package).</p>
<p>Don’t panic. For the mysterious function, have a look at its manual
page. Open up RStudio and use the object explorer to look at the
variables that go into the expression, and those that come out. Split up
the expression to look at intermediate values.</p>
<p>In Chapters 1 and 2, we use base R functionality for light doses of
plotting and data manipulation. As we successively need more
sophisticated operations, we introduce the ggplot2 way of making
graphics in Chapter 3. Besides the powerful grammar of graphics concepts
that enable us to produce sophisticated plots using only a limited set
of instructions, this implies using the dplyr way of data manipulation.
Sometimes, we have traded in what would be convoluted loop and lapply
constructs for elegant dplyr expressions, but this requires you to get
acquainted with some of the novelties in there including tibbles, the
group_by function and pipes (%&gt;%).</p>
<p>Why R and Bioconductor? There are many reasons why we have chosen to
present all analyses on the R (Ihaka and Gentleman 1996) and
Bioconductor (Huber et al. 2015) platforms:Download R and Rstudio to
follow the code in the book.</p>
<p>Cutting edge solutions. The availability of over 10 , 000 packages
ensures that almost all statistical methods are available, including the
most recent developments. Moreover, there are implementations of or
interfaces to many methods from computer science, mathematics, machine
learning, data management, visualization and internet technologies. This
puts thousands of person-years of work by experts at your finger tips.</p>
<p>Open source and community-owned. R and Bioconductor have been built
collaboratively by a large community of developers. They are constantly
tried and tested by thousands of users.</p>
<p>Data input and wrangling. Bioconductor packages support the reading of
many of the data types and formats produced by measurement instruments
used in modern biology, as well as the needed technology-specific
“preprocessing” routines. The community is actively keeping these
up-to-date with the rapid developments on the instrument market.</p>
<p>Simulation. There are random number generators for every known
statistical distribution and powerful numeric routines for linear
algebra, optimization, etc.</p>
<p>Visualization and presentation. R can make attractive,
publication-quality graphics. We’ve dedicated Chapter 3 to this and
practice data visualization extensively throughout the book.</p>
<p>Easy to use interactive development environment. RStudio is easy and fun
to use and helps with all aspects of programming in R. It is an
essential piece in following the iterative approach to data analysis
schematized in Figure 0.2.</p>
<p>Reproducibilty. As an equivalent to the laboratory notebook that is
standard good practice in labwork, we advocate the use of a
computational diary written in the R markdown format. We use the knitr
package to convert R markdown into easy-to-read and shareable HTML or
PDF documents. These can even become full-fledged scientific articles or
supplements. Together with a version control system, R markdown helps
with tracking changes.</p>
<p>Collaborative environment. R markdown enables the creation of websites
containing code, text, figures and tables with a minimum of work.</p>
<p>Rich data structures. The Bioconductor project has defined specialized
data containers to represent complex biological datasets. These help to
keep your data consistent, safe and easy to use.</p>
<p>Interoperability and distributed development. Bioconductor in particular
contains packages from diverse authors that cover a wide range of
functionalities but still interoperate because of the common data
containers.</p>
<p>Documentation. Many R packages come with excellent documentation in
their function manual pages and vignettes. The vignettes are usually the
best starting point into a package, as they give you a high-level
narrative on what the package does, whereas the manual pages give
detailed information on input, output and inner workings of each
function. There are online tutorials, fora and mailing lists for many
aspects of working with R and Bioconductor.</p>
<p>High-level language. R is an interpreted high-level language. Its roots
in LISP and its functional programming features mean that code is data
and can be computed on, which enables efficient programming and is fun.
These features facilitate constructing powerful domain specific
languages33 Examples include R’s formula interface, the grammar of
graphics in ggplot2, the data manipulation functionality of dplyr and R
markdown.. R is not a fixed language – throughout its history, it has
been actively evolving and is constantly improving.</p>

as the computational platform for this book – some more on this below.</p>

<p>The printed version of this book is supplemented by an online version at
<a href="http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book" class="uri">http://web.stanford.edu/class/bios221/book</a> or
<a href="https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb" class="uri">https://www.huber.embl.de/msmb</a>. The online site:</p>
<ul>
<li>provides the .R files and all needed input data files,</li>
<li>will be constantly updated to fix typos and make clarifications,</li>
<li>will have up-to-date code that will run with contemporary versions
of R, CRAN packages and Bioconductor.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>We will put notes and extra information under the devil icon, this is
the devil who looks after the details. Please do not despair if code in
the printed version of the book is not working with your version of R
and all the packages. Please do not despair if code on the website is
not working with an older version of R or packages.</strong> This is fully to
be expected and no reason for worries, surprises or even comments. We
recommend following the installation instructions –which includes
getting the right, matching versions of everything– on the webpage.</p>

<p>The chapters in the book build upon each other, but they are reasonably
self-contained, so they can also be studied selectively. Each chapter
starts with a motivations and goals section. Questions in the text will
help you check whether you are following along. The text contains
extensive R code examples throughout. You don’t need to scrape R code
from the HTML or manually copy it from the book. Please use the R
markdown files (extension <code>.Rmd</code>) on the book’s website. Each chapter
concludes with a summary of the main points and a set of exercises. The
book ends with an index and a concordance section, which should be
useful when looking for specific topics.</p>
